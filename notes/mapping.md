Longitude is given as an angular measurement ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward.

Latitude is an angle which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Without qualification the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude
Equator has a latitude of 0°, the North Pole has a latitude of 90° North (written 90° N or +90°), and the South Pole has a latitude of 90° South (written 90° S or −90°)

GPSLatitudeRef  N 
degrees,minutes,seconds
For calculations, the West/East suffix is replaced by a negative sign in the western hemisphere. 

GPSLatitude  42,56,42.960000000000001 
GPSLongitudeRef  W 
GPSLongitude  76,25,48.299999999999997 

For ESRI its almost always going to be:
Lat = Y Long = X

The terms easting and northing are geographic Cartesian coordinates for a point. Easting refers to the eastward-measured distance (or the x-coordinate), while northing refers to the northward-measured distance (or the y-coordinate).

Any point on the Equator's circle is of latitude 0°, the top north is 90° North, the top south is 90° South. Circles parallels to the Equator are of the same latitude. Longitude: it is the West/East value of a point on Earth. Longitudes are lines going from south pole to north pole.
